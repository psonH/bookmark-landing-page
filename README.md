# Bookmark landing page in React JS

I have build a landing page as part of the Frontend Mentor challenge project.

The project is built using React JS library.

## About the challenge

The challenge is to build out this landing page and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

The users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Receive an error message when the newsletter form is submitted if the email address is not formatted correctly

## Resources of the project

You will find all the required assets in the `/images` folder. The assets are already optimized.

There is also a `style-guide.md` file containing the information such as color palette and fonts.

## Deployed project

The project has been hosted on Netlify. Below is the project URL:

- [The Simple Bookmark Landing Page](https://bookmark-pson.netlify.app/)
